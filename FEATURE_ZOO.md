# FEATURE ZOO

Here, we provide strong features for temporal action localization on HACS and Epic-Kitchens-100. 

| dataset | model | resolution | features | classification | average mAP |
| ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| EK100 | ViViT Fact. Enc.-B16x2 | 32 x 2 | [features]() | [classification]() | 18.30 (A)) |
| EK100 | TAda2D | 8 x 8 | [features]() | [classification]() | 13.18 |
| HACS | TAda2D | 8 x 8 | [features]() | - | 32.3 |

Annotations used for temporal action localization with our codebase can be found [here]().

Pre-trained localization models using these features can be found in the [MODEL_ZOO.md](MODEL_ZOO.md).
