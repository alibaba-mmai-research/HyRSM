# Running instructions
To train the model with MoSI, set the `_BASE_RUN` to point to `configs/pool/run/training/mosi.yaml`. See `configs/projects/mosi/mosi_*.yaml` for more details. Alternatively, you can also find some pre-trained model in the `MODEL_ZOO.md`.

For detailed explanations on the approach itself, please refer to the [paper](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/papers/Huang_Self-Supervised_Motion_Learning_From_Static_Images_CVPR_2021_paper.pdf).

For an example run, set the `DATA_ROOT_DIR`, `ANNO_DIR` and `NUM_GPUS` in `configs/projects/mosi/mosi_r2d3ds_hmdb.yaml`, and run the command

```
python runs/run.py --cfg configs/projects/mosi/pt-hmdb/r2d3ds.yaml
```
