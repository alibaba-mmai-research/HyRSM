# Running instructions
Action recognition on Epic-Kitchens-100 share the same pipline with classification. Refer to `configs/projects/epic-kitchen-ar/vivit_fac_enc_ek100.yaml` for more details. We also include some trained weights in the [MODEL ZOO](MODEL_ZOO.md).

For an example run, set the `DATA_ROOT_DIR`, `ANNO_DIR` and `NUM_GPUS` in `configs/projects/epic-kitchen-ar/vivit_fac_enc_ek100.yaml`, and run the command

```
python runs/run.py --cfgconfigs/projects/epic-kitchen-ar/ek100/vivit_fac_enc.yaml
```
